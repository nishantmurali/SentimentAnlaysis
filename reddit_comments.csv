So far I wish the CT’s bed was lined with something; an order of gravel & unloading it with shovels will destroy that plastic and gauge it. Cabins are comparable but it’s smaller rear seat leg room and center console/middle seat space is less  than the Ram’s. My Ram also has the 6’4” bed which is an actual 6 foot bed with over wheel arches cut out so there is more room to stuff things in between (not useful always but when you need the wiggle room it’s better than nothing),13,1723991191.0

R1S - 2 times to LA, used Tesla Superchargers only with the A-Z adaptor. Range is more on point than our MX. More interior room for everybody to stretch out, rear screen isn’t updated for YouTube etc so still have to keep an iPad for the kids like MX. 

All cars go multiple times a year up to Vancouver BC. No issues along US I5/99 BC with charging. 

We are currently in central WA with the CT, goal is to drive it this year for our family of 4 for all road trips and see how its range estimate actually is. Space won’t be an issue & more security for our stuff in the back",10,1723995729.0

Only issue we’ve occurred in the R1S is third row head room is good, when the second row is fully reclined third row leg room is abysmal in R1S where as our 6 seat MX has pedestal seats so your feet have more space to extend under. 

Rivian prioritized more trunk space/full size spare in trunk > third row occupant where I think that was a mistake. If they gave the R1S third row 4” of more aft leg room it would make the trunk a bit shorter however it would compete with Tahoe/Navigator interior space American SUV’s bc the Frunk is far larger than the MX in the R1S so it wouldn’t really be an issue. 

Also they both needed power folding up/down seats. My 2007 GL450 came with that standard both of these manufactures could have easily done this. It’s harder to reach in to raise the Rivian third row seats than the MX since it doesn’t have a button but an push handle same as our Volvo",7,1723992839.0

Based on the completely different steering set up I’m imagining you are sitting much closer to the steering wheel and much more straight up and are probably used to sitting back and relaxing your lower back more. Using a new muscle group you aren’t used to using more is always going to cause soreness. My official recommendation is that you will probably get used to it as you use those muscles more and if you want it to get better faster look into core and lower back strengthening workouts and stretches similar to Pilates which has helped me immensely as an also 20 something year old who’s been dealing with a badly herniated disc for over a year now.

I definitely feel there’s too much space on the seat that I don’t need. But I drove 5 hours to Big Sur and back, and didn’t feel much discomfort. Just the usual body feeling lazy and wanting to stand up. 

I did feel I had to adjust my posture a lot! We drive 5+ hours a lot on M3 and I didn’t feel any discomfort though. 

Also, if you start today, your body will be in great shape in 6 months, where you won’t feel flexibility issues at all. Just stay consistent to the practice of stretching and mobility. You could also try calisthenics, if you’re male and intimidated by the number of women at a Pilates/lagree/solidcore studio. It literally has taken just 6 months of consistency (3-4 times a week minimum) for all my friends to see incredible flexibility and mobility! Praying for quick relief from your herniated disc pain ❤️‍🩹 I’m sure you’ll figure it out and have a painless healing soon! Have grace for yourself till then but also stay consistent in your recovery 💪",2,1723746612.0

Im sure it's a lovely vehicle to drive and ride in (I honestly haven't really been following the truck itself) but the news I'm hearing from the EMS community (and this document) make it a rather intimidating vehicle to deal with 

By no means is it uniquely difficult to deal with - there are plenty of conventional ICE cars that pose similar challenges - but first responders would probably benefit from a brief training course once there are enough of these on the road.

- don't cut people if they bump into them wrong

- don't have accelerator pedals that pose a danger to everyone

- tend not to brick upon delivery

- don't have their range cut in half by towing something

- have actual crumple zones for the benefit of everyone

- don't have near universal QC issues in terms of general fit and finish for cars of similar cost

- don't have panels literally just glued to the car

- were not recalled 4 times within a couple months of initial deliveries

There’s more coming. My favorite is the finger in mouth gagging gesture. Classic hater.  Next time say “ Now drive yourself to that gas station and give the Arabs your money boy”,2,1723212604.0

Nothing special but this guy had his huge exhaust that shoots out black smog when he really kicks the gas.  You all know the type. Anyway. He was slowing down just to smoke me and I could feel it. Poor boy, it takes him 2 seconds smoke me but it only took me 1 to fly past him. The fun I had for about 10 minutes as he tried to time it but failed.   I’d slow down so he’d get ready and then leave him in his own smog. Best payback ever.",2,1723324433.0

I live in Broward county FL, and my first drive home an excited guy in a work truck rolled down his window, motioned for me to roll down mine and told me how much his kid loves my truck.

I then proceeded to be regularly swarmed by people who were all super positive about it. I've had it a couple months and the worst thing that has happened until today was someone saying they thought it was ugly.

Today I am on a road trip up in the panhandle and on two separate occasions, someone has swerved around from behind me, cut me off, and flipped me the bird.

I thought Broward was pretty liberal and the panhandle was pretty conservative. These vehicles cutting me off did not look stereotypically conservative.",1,1723177780.0
